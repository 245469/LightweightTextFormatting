# Laptop

A laptop is a portable personal computer designed for mobile use. It includes a display, keyboard, touchpad, and internal hardware in a single compact unit that can be easily carried and used in different locations such as home, school, or office.

## Types of Laptops

Traditional laptops are designed for general-purpose use. They offer a balance between performance, battery life, and portability and are commonly used for office work, studying, and browsing the internet.

Ultrabooks are thin and lightweight laptops focused on mobility and long battery life. They usually use energy-efficient components and solid-state drives, making them fast and convenient for travel.

Gaming laptops are built for high performance and include powerful processors and dedicated graphics cards. They are larger and heavier due to advanced cooling systems required for intensive tasks such as gaming and video editing.

## Laptop Hardware

Laptop hardware includes all physical components that make the device work, such as processing units, memory, storage, and display systems. These components are optimized to use less power while still providing acceptable performance.

Because laptops are compact, their hardware must be carefully arranged to reduce heat and save space. This limits upgrade options compared to desktop computers, but allows for lightweight and portable designs.
